Skynet Robotics initially relied on traditional version control systems (VCS) for their software development. However, they eventually adopted Git due to its fast merging, branching features, and Git flow techniques. This allowed for rapid development and fail-fast scenarios, which helped them quickly convert their prototypes into production models and accelerate their go-to-market strategy.

The adoption of Git by Skynet Robotics was a wise decision as it helped them to achieve rapid development and accelerate their go-to-market strategy. Git provides a powerful set of tools for managing software development, including fast merging, branching features, and Git flow techniques. By using these tools, Skynet Robotics was able to quickly iterate on their prototypes, test new features, and quickly convert them into production models. Additionally, Git's fail-fast scenarios allowed them to catch errors early in the development process, minimizing the time and resources spent on debugging. Overall, the use of Git was a significant factor in Skynet Robotics' success, and it highlights the importance of choosing the right tools and technologies for software development.
